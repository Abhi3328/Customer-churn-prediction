# Customer-churn-prediction
This project predicts customer churn using machine learning models and ensemble techniques, with SMOTE applied to handle data imbalance. It compares models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, along with ensemble methods, to determine the most accurate approach for churn prediction.
